Copyright is a set of statutory rights granted “to the proprietor of an intellectual production to its exclusive use and enjoyment to the extent specified in the statute.”[^1] According to this definition, copyright is an exclusive set of rights subject to limitations set by the statute granting such right. This definition is reflected in the Intellectual Property Code (IP Code) which enumerates the following set of exclusive economic rights subject to the provisions on the Chapter on Limitations on Copyright:
1.	Reproduction of the work or substantial portion of the work;
2.	Dramatization, translation, adaptation, abridgment, arrangement or other transformation of the work;
3.	The first public distribution of the original and each copy of the work by sale or other forms of transfer of ownership;
4.	Rental of the original or a copy of an audiovisual or cinematographic work, a work embodied in a sound recording, a computer program, a compilation of data and other materials or a musical work in graphic form, irrespective of the ownership of the original or the copy which is the subject of the rental;
5.	Public display of the original or a copy of the work;
6.	Public performance of the work; and
7.	Other communication to the public of the work.[^2]

If any of these rights are exercised without the consent of the copyright holder in an injurious manner such that the original work is substantially diminished, then there is infringement.[^3] One of the limitations set by the IP Code on the exclusivity of these rights, which is arguably the most important and expansive limitation (as it applies to all rights of copyright and all copyrightable works[^4]) is fair use.[^5] Section 185 of the IP Code simply defines fair use in the negative: “fair use of a copyrighted work…is not an infringement of copyright.”[^6]

These two concepts of infringement and fair use are, therefore, two opposite ends of the spectrum of possible uses of copyrighted works. As such, use of a copyrighted work may either be fair or an infringement based on whether such use is injurious or in contravention to the purpose of copyright. [^7]

## Infringement

As discussed, not all copying is infringement. In other words, copying *per se* does not equate to a finding of an infringement. Thus, even if a person willfully copies a few pages of a book, or even the whole thereof, it does not automatically mean that he is guilty of infringement. According to *Microsoft Corporation v. Manansala*, there is an actionable copyright infringement when any of the acts exclusively granted to the copyright owner is committed without his consent.[^8]  In *Microsoft*, the Court reiterated its earlier pronouncement that:

> \[i\]nfringement of a copyright is *a trespass on a private domain owned and occupied by the owner of the copyright*, and, therefore, protected by law, and infringement of copyright, or piracy, which is a synonymous term in this connection, consists in the doing by any person, without the consent of the owner of the copyright, of anything the sole right to do which is conferred by statute on the owner of the copyright.[^9]

It further stated that the “gravamen of infringement” is the unauthorized performance of any of the acts exclusively granted by the statute, not merely the unauthorized manufacturing of intellectual works.[^10]

To demonstrate a *prima facie* case of infringement, the plaintiff only needs to prove two elements: “*(1)* ownership of a valid copyright and *(2)* copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.”[^11] The ownership of a valid copyright is comprised of the following: 

1. originality in the author;
2. copyrightability of the subject matter; 
3. a national point of attachment of the work, such as to permit a claim of copyright; 
4. compliance with the applicable statutory formalities; and 
4. (if the plaintiff is not the author) a transfer of rights or other relationship between the author and the plaintiff so as to constitute the plaintiff as the valid copyright claimant.[^12]

Most of the time, there is no dispute regarding the element of ownership as it is easily demonstrated by a certificate of registration[^13] or an affidavit evidence that are deemed *prima facie* proof of ownership.[^14]

A little bit more contentious, but still an easy burden, is the second element—copying which amounts to an actionable copying.[^15] There are two components of actionable copying: *(1)* actual copying and *(2)* “the copying amounts to an improper or unlawful appropriation.”[^16] 

In fair use cases, the first component is almost always undisputed.[^17] After all, fair use necessitates a use or a copying of the original work. 

Proving the second component requires a demonstration that the alleged infringing work has “’substantial similarity’ to protected expression in the infringed work.”[^18] There is substantial similarity when what was copied in the earlier work was protected expression and the amount copied was more than *de minimis*.[^19] 

In this connection, expression is protected when it is original, which simply means that the work was independently created by the author and that it possesses a modicum of creativity.[^20] Meanwhile, determining whether the amount copied was more than *de minimis* is simply an analysis of how much and how vital the copied parts are.[^21]

Once all these are established, there is already a *prima facie* case of infringement.[^22] Curiously, there is no inquiry as to the proof of harm to the plaintiff[^23] even though infringement is supposedly injurious copying or appropriation.[^24] In this regard, an analysis of fair use in determining infringement closes this seeming gap between actionable copying and injurious copying.[^25]

## Fair Use

Fair use is one of the most important concepts in copyright.[^26] It has been described as a privilege;[^27] other times, an exception or an excuse;[^28] sometimes, a right.[^29] Indeed, fair use escapes a definitive meaning. But the language of the law makes one thing clear: fair use is not an infringement,[^30] not even an excused one.[^31] 

Instances of fair use may be seen in the academe such as photocopying of copyrighted materials which have become widespread as it made learning materials more accessible to students and teachers alike;[^32] in the field of research where researchers resorted to photocopying in order to enable easier dissemination of resources;[^33] for reporting purposes;[^34] or for criticizing another’s work.[^35]

When a use of a copyrighted work is deemed fair, then there can be no infringement.[^36] There are four non-exclusive factors[^37] in determining whether a particular act qualifies as fair use of a copyrighted work:
1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is of non-profit educational purposes;
2. The nature of the copyrighted work;
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.[^38]

<v-img src="fair_use.svg" alt="Fair Use"></v-img>

Determining whether an act constitutes fair use requires a case-by-case analysis of the relevant factors without bright-line rules.[^39] When the factors are considered, they are weighed together, not in isolation from each other, thereby creating a balancing act in light of the purposes of copyright.[^40] The natural consequence of this flexibility is vagueness in the application of the doctrine such that fair use cases are often shrouded in uncertainty and unpredictability.[^41] This, however, is by design as “the doctrine is intended to contemplate all circumstances that could possibly justify protecting a use from copyright’s suppression.”[^42] Such was the intention so that the fair use doctrine can guarantee breathing space within the confines of copyright.[^43]

In cases where there is much uncertainty, presumption plays an essential role – indeed, “presumption becomes dispositive.”[^44] When there is doubt as to where the evidence tilts regarding the issue, he who has the burden of proof loses.[^45] At present, fair use is considered an affirmative defense in which the defendant has the burden of proving fair use.[^46] Thus, as there is often doubt as to the determination of fair use,[^47] the defendant is likely to lose because of the presumption.

Ironically, the intended uncertainty of the fair use doctrine which was designed to protect fair users now works against them.[^48] This has not always been the case. For a long period of time, fair use has been the norm and copyright the exception.[^49] Thus, the burden of proving unfair use to prevail in an infringement case originally rested with the copyright holders.[^50] 

To understand the foundation of the shift in the treatment of fair use, it is thus imperative to examine the historical development of fair use and copyright law which shall be the topic of the next part of this series.

*This series **The Right Place of the Fair Use Doctrine** argues that fair use is a right, and as such, it is the copyright holder's burden to prove that an alleged infringer violated fair use in cases of copyright infringement.*
