title: 'Liberating Information for a Learned Citizenry'
description: >
  This Paper challenges the notion of fair use as an affirmative defense. The statutory fair use is undeniably incompatible with the concept of affirmative defense. Further, such treatment not only runs contrary to the language of the law, it is also repugnant to the historical and Constitutional objective of copyrightâ€”to promote the diffusion of knowledge for the benefit of the public. To restore the balance, fair use and infringement must be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Therefore, it is impossible to determine infringement without inquiring into the possibility of fair use.
